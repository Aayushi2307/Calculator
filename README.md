I have developed calculator using Android. This is a basic calculator which will do arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo.

Here's why:
* This Application is light and easy to use.
* It is simple to use.....

Use `activity_main.xml` to get started with frontend.

Use `MainActivity.java` to get started with backened.
